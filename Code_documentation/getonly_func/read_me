# The set of 3 getonly function is a very crude solution
# that attempts to extract allele frequency information from
# raws tsv generated with VCFtools, which are too large to be read into 
# memory in one go
# The way this raw file is generated gives it the following column order
# CHROM, POS, REF, ALT, 10x AF columns, 10x AN columns, 10x AC columns, 
# with one for each population
# each function specify which sets of columns to read using a string that 
# is passed to ColClasses argument of read.table
